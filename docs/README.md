## Project Objective

This project was created with the purpose of practicing and demonstrating the knowledge acquired in virtual classes about Data Modeling and SQL in a case that can be applied in everyday life.

The main objectives are to provide an IT solution through the design of a database for a problem that can occur in real life and to be able to apply the content taught in online classes effectively.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Knowledge Learned and Worked On

- Use of **Databases**, **Data Modeling Diagrams**, and **SQL**.
- Identification of:
  - Entities and Relationships.
  - Attributes and Types.
  - Primary and Foreign Keys.
  - Cardinality I-II-III.
  - Normalization I-II-III-IV-V-VI-VII.
- **Creation**, **Modification**, **Deletion** of Tables.
- **Insertion** and **Extraction** of data from the Created Tables.

## Project Details

There is a Video Club that does not have the appropriate software to manage the business efficiently, so we are asked to create a new database based on the information provided by the client.

- It is necessary to register the **Members** who visit the Video Club. We need Name, Surnames, Date of Birth, Phone, and Identification Number.
- It is necessary to register the **Mailing Address** of the Members. We need Postal Code, Street, Number, and Floor. The Address is **optional** to register.
- It is necessary to register **Movies**. We need the Title, Genre, Director, and Synopsis of each. Additionally, each Movie can have more than one copy.
- It is necessary to know which Member has **Borrowed** each copy and when; that is, the date they took it and the return date. When a movie has no return date, it is considered borrowed.
- Additionally, it is necessary to query which movies are available to rent at this moment (those that are not borrowed). We need to know the movie title and the number of copies available.
